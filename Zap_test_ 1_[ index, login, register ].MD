# Security Report

## Issue 1: Cloud Metadata Potentially Exposed
- **URL:** `http://192.168.2.122:5173/latest/meta-data/`
- **Risk:** High
- **Confidence:** Low
- **Attack:** `169.254.169.254`
- **Description:**
  The Cloud Metadata Attack attempts to abuse a misconfigured NGINX server in order to access the instance metadata maintained by cloud service providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. All of these providers provide metadata via an internal unroutable IP address `169.254.169.254`. This can be exposed by incorrectly configured NGINX servers and accessed by using this IP address in the Host header field.
- **Solution:**
  Do not trust any user data in NGINX configs. In this case, it is probably the use of the `$host` variable, which is set from the 'Host' header and can be controlled by an attacker.

## Issue 2: Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set
- **URL:** `http://192.168.2.122:5173`
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Confidence:** High
- **Description:**
  Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. It allows website owners to declare approved sources of content.
- **Solution:**
  Ensure that your web server, application server, or load balancer is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

## Issue 3: Cross-Domain Misconfiguration
- **URL:** `http://192.168.2.122:5173`
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Attack:** `access-control-allow-origin: *`
- **Description:**
  Web browser data loading may be possible due to a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server. This could be exploited by an attacker to access sensitive data.
- **Solution:**
  Ensure sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner. Configure the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains or remove all CORS headers entirely.

## Issue 4: Missing Anti-clickjacking Header
- **URL:** `http://192.168.2.122:5173`
- **Risk:** Medium
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Attack:** `x-frame-options`
- **Description:**
  The response does not protect against clickjacking attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with `frame-ancestors` directive or `X-Frame-Options`.
- **Solution:**
  Use `X-Frame-Options` with `DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN`, or configure a Content Security Policy to prevent clickjacking.

## Issue 5: X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing
- **URL:** `http://192.168.2.122:5173`
- **Risk:** Low
- **Confidence:** Medium
- **Description:**
  The anti-MIME-sniffing header `X-Content-Type-Options` was not set to `nosniff`. This allows browsers to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response to be interpreted as a different content type.
- **Solution:**
  Ensure that the application or web server sets the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` for all web pages.
